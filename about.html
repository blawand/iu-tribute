                <img src="images/about-debut-placeholder.jpg" alt="Early IU" class="content-image-right">
                <p>Born Lee Ji-eun on May 16, 1993, her path to stardom wasn't immediate. Facing numerous audition rejections and early struggles, she debuted in 2008 with "Lost Child." While technically skilled, her initial image didn't immediately capture the public's imagination.</p>
                <p>The turning point arrived with "Good Day" in 2010. Its iconic three-octave high note propelled her to national fame, earning her the title "Nation's Little Sister." This success marked the beginning of an incredible trajectory, but IU quickly proved she was more than just a fleeting sensation.</p>
                 <p>Through subsequent releases like 'Real+', 'Last Fantasy,' and 'Modern Times,' she began showcasing her burgeoning talent as a songwriter and her desire to explore diverse musical styles, gradually shedding the 'little sister' image and evolving into a mature, respected artist.</p>

                 <img src="images/about-songwriter-placeholder.jpg" alt="IU writing" class="content-image-left">
                <p>One of IU's most defining characteristics is her profound skill as a lyricist and composer. Starting with tentative contributions, she gradually took more creative control, penning lyrics that are deeply personal yet universally relatable.</p>
                <p>Her songs often explore themes of youth, love, loss, self-reflection, societal commentary, and the complexities of growing up. From the witty observations in "Palette" and "Twenty-Three" to the poignant storytelling in "Through the Night" and "Dear Name," her lyrics resonate with honesty and poetic sensibility. She masterfully uses metaphors and narratives to connect with listeners on an emotional level, making her music timeless.</p>
